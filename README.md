I do some redacting of server log files.

Sometimes, it's just a few lines, othertimes there are volumes to go through.

This removes IP addresses and replaces them with x.x.x.x
Also removes machine names, loging names and MAC's

Uses Qt for the GUI but the redactor engine can be removed for
use with other GUIS's, or just command line apps.
